# Exploratory Data Analysis on Wine Dataset

Description: This project contains code and documentation for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a wine dataset. The dataset consists of information on red and white types of wine, including their chemical properties and quality ratings. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the relationships between various wine attributes and their quality ratings.

The project includes Jupyter notebooks with Python code for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. The EDA covers descriptive statistics, data visualization, correlation analysis, and feature selection. The findings are summarized in a report that includes insights and recommendations for future analysis.

The project is organized into the following directories:

data in csv files: containing the raw and cleaned datasets. notebooks code files: containing the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis. reports as pdf files: containing the EDA report. This analysis can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring the wine dataset or performing EDA on similar datasets. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
