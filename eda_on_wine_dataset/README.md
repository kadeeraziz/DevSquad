AFG DevSquad - Collaborative Software Development

Welcome to the AFG DevSquad repository, where a team of software engineers work together to build innovative, high-quality software solutions. Our mission is to create software that makes a positive impact, whether that's by solving complex problems, improving user experiences, or making everyday tasks more efficient.

Our team includes developers with a range of skills and expertise, including front-end and back-end development, DevOps, data science, database design, user experience design, and more. We believe that collaboration is key to creating great software, so we work together to share knowledge, brainstorm ideas, and support each other in solving challenges.

In this repository, you'll find the code for our latest software project, as well as documentation, issue tracking, and other resources to support our development process. We welcome contributions from other developers who share our passion for creating great software, so please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests if you'd like to get involved.
