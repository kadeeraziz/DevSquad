# AFG DevSquad - DataSci Projects

Welcome to the Data Science Projects branch! This branch contains several data science projects, each of which includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning algorithms.

Each project is organized into its own directory and includes code, data, and documentation. The EDA explores the data to gain insights and understanding, while the machine learning algorithms are developed to create models that can make predictions or classifications.

To get started with a project, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Each project includes a README file that provides instructions on how to run the code, reproduce the analyses, and understand the results.

We hope that these projects inspire you and help you learn more about data science! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
